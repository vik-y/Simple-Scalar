Simple-Scalar
=============
Simple-Scalar is a Computer Architecture Simulation tool, <a href="http://www.simplescalar.com">Click Here</a> for more information<br>

<strong>In this Project I have added an extra level of cache - L3 cache, the code related to it is available in </strong>
```
/simplesim-3.0/sim-cache.c
```
NOTE: For adding any new level of cache, you just need to modify the L3 Cache file. <br>


<strong>Folders</strong> <br>
* /bin <br>
* /simplesim-3.0 <br>
* /testcases <br>


/bin  : Contains Essential files, no modification required <br>
/simplesim-3.0 : Contains all the essential files which need to be modified <br>
/testcases : Contains all the testcases which I generated to test the  performance of additional level of cache and its performance<br>

<br>
There are some shell scripts in testcases folder which will make your testing easier.
